# Hale Pau Hana

Welcome to the Hale Pau Hana repository! This project aims to build a stunning website for a Hawaiian resort property that is built on Astro, a modern static site builder. The website will showcase the beauty and amenities of the resort, providing visitors with an immersive experience of the Hawaiian paradise.

By leveraging Astro's powerful features, such as its component-based architecture and seamless integration with popular frameworks, we can create a fast, dynamic, and visually appealing website. The repository will contain the necessary code, assets, and configurations to develop and deploy the website.

Join us in this exciting journey as we bring the spirit of Hawaii to life through an exceptional online presence for Hale Pau Hana resort!
